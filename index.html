<p>We are professional software developers, and we
are passionate about it. As such, we strive to improve and are open
to learn and apply any methodologies that can help us to do so. We
do not, however, buy into silver bullet solutions or feel-good
empty talk. <strong>We call bullshit, and we mean it.</strong>

<p>These will be our principles of bullshit-calling</p>

<p><strong>We will listen and
    read.</strong> Not everything is bullshit, but if it sounds too
good to be true, it&rsquo;s probably not true. Be open, but
critical.
<p><strong>We will call bullshit when we see it.</strong> This will make people unhappy, but we value honesty above popularity.</p>
<p><strong>We will admit being wrong when we are.</strong> We will be wrong sometimes, and thatâ€™s ok. We are learning, too.</p>
<p><strong>We have fallen for bullshit in the past.</strong>We are not better than anyone else, but we acknowdledge that there's a need for growth, criticism and maturity.</p>

<h4>Be open, honest and critical: call bullshit and mean it</h4>
